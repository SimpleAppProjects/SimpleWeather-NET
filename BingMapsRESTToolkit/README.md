# Bing Maps REST Toolkit for .NET 

This is a portable .NET class library which provides a set of tools that make it easy to access the Bing Maps REST services in .NET based apps. Take a look at the [Getting Started documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/BingMapsRESTToolkit/blob/master/Docs/Getting%20Started.md). The Bing Maps REST Services provides the following functionality:

* **Autosuggest**
* **Forward and reverse geocoding**
* **Route calculations** - for driving, walking, transit and truck
* **Distance matricies** - time and distance based matrices between a set of origins and destinations. Optionally retrieve this data over a period of time using predictive traffic data
* **Isochrones** (drive time polygons)
* **Snap to Road API** - snap GPS points to their closest logical point on a road. Also provides speed limit data
* **Traffic incident data**
* **Elevation data**
* **Static map imagery and metadata**
* **Local search**
* And much more!

## Toolkit Features

* Uses HTTPS by default.
* Implements the documented [best practices for Bing Maps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn894107.aspx). For example, it automatically encodes query parameters. A commonly overlooked stepped which greatly reduces the chances of invalid queries being sent to the service.
* Handles errors and rate limiting by catching exception and returning response with error message.
* Automatically determines when a POST request should be made instead of a GET request.
* Fast indexed lookups of Distance Matrix results.
* Supports calculating driving, truck, walking and transit routes that have more than 25 waypoints.
* **Travelling Salesmen** algorithms that tie into the distance matrix API [documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/BingMapsRESTToolkit/blob/master/Docs/Getting%20Started.md#TravellingSalesmen). 
* **Truck routing based Distance Matricies** - The Bing Maps distance matric API does not support truck routing based matricies. This library adds support for this by wrapping the truck routing API.
